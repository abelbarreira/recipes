## Recipe

1. Prepare the Spring Onions:
   1. Essentially you need to cut your onions in half separating the lighter/whiter bottoms from the dark green tops. First though, chop off the roots of your onions.
   2. The whiter parts of green onions are much more pungent and onion-like. These bits need to be chopped up fine.
   3. The darker green tops need to be cut lengthwise into thirds around 5-8 cm long
